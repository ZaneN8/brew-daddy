    <p>
      Brew Daddy was started on the second of October in the grim year of 2020.
      Four bearded heros brought together by a common dream, make life better
      with all things brew. Our goal is to let the world know about that awesome
      spot down on the corner that makes a perfect cup of coffee, the best place
      to study, or has your favorite panini sandwich like no where else. Connect
      with other coffee aficionados and support local businesses.
