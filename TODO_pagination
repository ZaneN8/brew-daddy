And this is kaminari, a gem for pagination. It's pretty much the standard for pagination in rails.

@Jon I would start with making a controller action that does a basic match for the coffeeshop title and paginates the results. We can worry about extending the filters afterward.

sounds good. might need to change the seeds to have keyword in the search

Our requests will not pass data in the request body, they'll be passed into the query parameters. So the request url will look something like:
api/coffee_shops?title=roasters&page=2
and in rails the data will come back at the top level of params instead of nested inside of params[:coffee_shop]

We can either write query parameters explicitly in the URL, or axios can accept them via an options object. We won't have to worry about that for a while though.
